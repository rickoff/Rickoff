version 0.0.1

botvocaltes3mp = Bot Vocal Discord with position player in server tes3mp

the name of the players on the game should match the nickname of the user on discord

description:
- recovery of the position of the players in the game
- creation of a corresponding channel in discord
- displacement of the users on the good channel if it is already present in a vocal channel
- delete of the unused channel

Problems encountered:

- the last players to disconnect from the game will still be automatically moved to the channel corresponding to the last zone traveled.
solution: the players will have to modify a letter of his pseudo discord to circumvent the bug
